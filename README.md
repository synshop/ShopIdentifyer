Introduction
===
Over the past two years, the [SYN Shop hacker/makerspace](https://www.synshop.org) has grown to where the management of validating membership when entering the shop is no longer a first-name basis and was in need of something more robust and automated.

Setup (Development)
===

1. Requirements
  * Python 2.7.x
  * virtualenv 1.11.x
  * MySQL 5.6.x
  * USB / Serial RFID Reader (see below)

2. Set up a [python virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) and [virtualenvwrapper](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/#virtualenvwrapper), grab the source and pip install the requirements.txt file included:

        $ mkvirtualenv ShopIdentifyer
        $ workon ShopIdentifyer
        $ cd ShopIdentifyer
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Additionally, the system needs a ./identity/config.py file with the following properties:

        ENCRYPTED_STRIPE_TOKEN = 'encrypted-token'
        ENCRYPTED_DATABASE_PASSWORD = 'encrypted-password'
        ENCRYPTED_MAIL_USERNAME = 'encrypted-mail-username'
        ENCRYPTED_MAIL_PASSWORD = 'encrypted-mail-password'

        ENCRYPTED_SESSION_KEY = 'session-key-salt'
        ENCRYPTED_ADMIN_PASSPHRASE = "encrypted-admin-password"

        DATABASE_USER = 'root'
        DATABASE_HOST = 'localhost'
        DATABASE_PORT = 3306
        DATABASE_SCHEMA = "shopidentifyer"

        STRIPE_CACHE_REFRESH_MINUTES=60

        MAIL_SERVER = 'localhost'
        MAIL_PORT = 22
        MAIL_USE_TLS = True
        MAIL_USE_SSL = False
        MAIL_DEBUG = True

        ACCESS_CONTROL_HOSTNAME = 'localhost'
        ACCESS_CONTROL_SSH_PORT = 22

Please note that <em style="background-color:#FFD700">some of these properties are encrypted.  When the web server starts up, it will prompt you for a decryption password.</em>  This is the same password that you will use to encrypt the properties using the tool in ./identity/crypto/crypt.py.  The instructions for use are pretty straightforward:

    $ python crypt.py

    Usage: crypt.py encrypt
           crypt.py decrypt

The Serial Remote
===
In addition to the Flask web application, there is an out of process daemon that listens for incoming
RFID swipes on a given serial port, and then pushes them into the system.

The daemon is located in ./serial_remote/serial_listener.py and can be started as follows:

    $ python serial_remote/serial_listener.py start

Please note that this assumes you have already set up a virtualenv with the requirements.txt satisfied.

Inside of ./serial_remote/config.py, you can change the value for the RFID serial device.  My reader shows up as:

    /dev/tty.usbserial-A800509r



The RFID Reader
===

We are using the following RFID reader + USB breakout board:

SparkFun RFID USB Reader
  * https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9963

RFID Reader ID-12LA (125 kHz)
  * https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11827


Ubuntu Quick Setup
===
	$ apt-get install python-dev python-virtualenv virtualenvwrapper \
                      git mysql-server-5.6 libmysqlclient-dev nginx
